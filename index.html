  <p> Magdalena Kusserow was born on 23rd January 1924 in Bochum in Germany.She was the eighth of eleven children. During the 1920s her parents Franz and Hilda became Jehovah’s Witnesses and they brought up their children in their new faith. In 1931 they moved to the small town of Bad Lippspringe where their house became a centre of Witness activity. They held Bible study classes in their home and distributed religious literature in local communities

    When Hitler came to power in 1933. In accordance with their religious beliefs, Jehovah’s Witnesses did not accept the authority of the Nazi regime and refused to be conscripted or participate in any military service. Several thousand Jehovah’s Witnesses were arrested and sent to concentration camps and an estimated 250 others were executed after being tried by military tribunals.

Magdalena and the other members of her family were arrested and after spending six months in a juvenile prison, she was told to sign a declaration renouncing her beliefs or face further imprisonment. Magdalena refused and returned to prison before being sent to Ravensbrück concentration camp in northern Germany. She remained in Ravensbrück from 1942 until 1945, when she and other prisoners were evacuated from the camp in the wake of the Soviet advance through Germany. The prisoners were discovered and freed by Soviet troops. </p>
